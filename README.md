# Jotter: to do list app
Welcome to Jotter, a simple to do list app that you can run from the command line.

## Getting started
Jotter can be run directly via Gradle or via a generated jar file.

### Run with Gradle
In the root folder, start Jotter with the following command:
```bash
gradle run --console plain
```
### Run with jar file
First, generate the jar file with Gradle's build command.
```bash
gradle build
```
The jar file will be generated in `build/libs`. Run it using the command:
```bash
java -jar build/libs/to-do-list-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Using this app
This app helps you track the tasks you need to do. Here's how:
