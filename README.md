# Jotter: to do list app
Welcome to Jotter, a simple to do list app that you can run from the command line.

## Getting started
Jotter can be run directly via Gradle or via a generated jar file.

### Run with Gradle
In the root folder, start Jotter with the following command:
```bash
gradle run --console plain
```
### Run with jar file
First, generate the jar file with Gradle's build command.
```bash
gradle build
```
The jar file will be generated in `build/libs`. Run it using the command:
```bash
java -jar build/libs/to-do-list-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Using this app
This app helps you track the tasks you need to do.
It loads the task list from the previous session or creates a new one if there was a problem loading.
The welcome message gives an overview of total tasks and number of tasks done.
The main menu has 4 options. Make your selection by typing a number (1 to 4) and pressing enter.

Then choose if you want to edit the task details, mark it as done or remove it completely.
